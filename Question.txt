Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I am interested in taking CMSC320 because I want to learn more about how data gets 
utilized in our day to day technology usage. I'm also partaking in research where I 
have to compare data to our own research and analyze the differences. Lastly, I 
currently have a job where I manage databases and utilize SQL- I want to learn more 
professionally how data sceince can be used in the job setting.
